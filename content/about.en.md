Doctors can use this to talk to their patients using video.

## Goals
- less patients coming into hospitals in person
- infected doctors in quarantine can still contribute by doing online triage
- medicine students can be included to screen patients
- volunteers can help set appointments and do audio/video testing with patients 5 minutes before the appointment starts

## How to
staff can create appointments with a doctor for a patient, who gets a link to their personal videochatroom.
Each patient gets an individual room/link.
No account creation is needed. The videocall happens directly in the patients browser. On mobile devices the patients visiting the link are asked to install the jitsi app, and automatically redirected to the room after completing the installation.
