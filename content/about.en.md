Doctors can use this to talk to their patients using video.

## Goals
- less patients coming into hospitals in person
- infected doctors in quarantine can still contribute by doing online triage
- medicine students can be included to screen patients

## How to
staff can create appointments with a doctor for a patient, who gets a link to their personal videochatroom.
Each patient gets an individual room/link.
No software installation or account creation is needed. The videocall happens directly in the patients browser, on whichever device they happen to use.
